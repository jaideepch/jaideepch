<p>The ForeSee Web SDK setup is complete. Please download the code package (linked below), and follow the instructions
    in our self-hosting instructions article to get the files bootstrapped onto your website. The Embed Snippet (contained in embedsnippet.html in the ZIP)
    attached can be added to your website template. It needs to appear on every page of your website, ideally in the HEAD area. Don't forget to
    include it on special areas of the site like in the checkout process and 'logged in' areas. This is so that we have
    flexibility in how the triggering behaviour works across your site. Also, if at some point in the future you adopt
    other ACS products, it greatly simplifies the process of deploying them, since the code will already exist on the
    pages you need it to be. There are two attached .txt files. One includes an Embed Snippet for your testing
    environment. The other includes an Embed Snippet for your production environment. If you prefer to use only a single
    Embed Snippet across all environments you only need to reference the production .txt file.</p>

<b>Client Testing Recommended</b>

<p>The ForeSee implementation team tests the trigger code via proxy technique on your production website as long as it
    is publicly available. It is tested in Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome and Safari to ensure the survey invitation
    process and survey display meets the business objectives communicated by the client team.
    However, each clients' testing environment, deployment process and testing process is unique and therefore it is
    highly recommended that additional testing be done by your team prior to deploying this code to production.

    If you have any questions regarding these instructions or need help troubleshooting an issue, please contact us.

    Thank you!
