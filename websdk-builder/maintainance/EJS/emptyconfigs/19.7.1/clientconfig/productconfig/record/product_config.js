     * @name pii The PII JSON that targets which elements should be
     *       masked/unmasked. Note that we now use masking syntax. EG:
     *       "*myURLFragment*". See utils.testAgainstSearch() for docs.
     *
     * Note: by default, all contents of all pages are masked, including all
     * text inputs. Everything that follows is about loosening that
     * restriction.
     *
     * Also Note: inputs are always masked by default (whitelisting mode),
     * even if the rest of the page is in the pagesToSelectiveMask list and
     * has selectiveMaskZones set up. This is to make really sure that
     * inputs cannot accidently leak PII. If a new field is added to a form,
     * it will always be masked unless configured otherwise with
     * visibleInputs
     *
     * UPGRADING: The code has a very simple algorithm to assist in
     * upgrading old configs. Simply run record with the old configs and it
     * will emit a helpful console message (even in production) with a crude
     * guess of what the config should be. It just copy-pastes some of the
     * old configs into the new fields. Just copy-paste that into the pii
     * block below and go from there. You may need to clean up some bad
     * guesses and properly configure pagesToSelectiveMask.
     *
     * @prop {Object} selectiveUnMaskZones this defines areas of pages to be
     *       UNMASKED on pages that would normally be completely masked
     *       (whitelisting).
     *
     * @prop {Array<String>} pagesToSelectiveMask This identifies page
     *       URL's (by wildcard) that switch from automatic mask-everything
     *       (whitelisting) to blacklisting. If a page falls into this
     *       category, we ignore all rules inside selectiveUnMaskZones and
     *       look instead at selectiveMaskZones.
     *
     * @prop {Object} selectiveMaskZones Identifies elements on pages to
     *       mask for pages that are in pagesToSelectiveMask. A page must
     *       already be in the pagesToSelectiveMask list to qualify for this
     *       type of masking.
     *
     * @prop {Object} visibleInputs Identifies inputs, textareas and selects
     *       to unblock. Works even when elements are inserted into
     *       document. Only use this when necessary, it's not as efficient.
     *
     * @prop {Object} redactZones Identifies elements to obscuring. This
     *       will result in everything inside it to be blacked out,
     *       including images and text. This still could reasult in the
     *       contents being transmitted to the server, but the viewer will
     *       not see it. Useful for profile images and the like.
