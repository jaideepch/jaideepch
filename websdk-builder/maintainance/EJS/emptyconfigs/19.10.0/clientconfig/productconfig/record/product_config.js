     * @name pii The PII JSON that targets which elements should be masked/unmasked. Note that we now use
     * masking syntax. EG: "*myURLFragment*". See utils.testAgainstSearch() for docs.
     *
     * Note: by default, all contents of all pages are masked, including all text inputs. Everything
     * that follows is about loosening that restriction.
     *
     * Also Note: inputs are always masked by default (whitelisting mode), even if the rest of the page
     * is in the pagesToSelectiveMask list and has selectiveMaskZones set up. This is to make really sure
     * that inputs cannot accidently leak PII. If a new field is added to a form, it will always be masked
     * unless configured otherwise with visibleInputs
     *
     * UPGRADING: The code has a very simple algorithm to assist in upgrading old configs. Simply run record
     * with the old configs and it will emit a helpful console message (even in production) with a crude
     * guess of what the config should be. It just copy-pastes some of the old configs into the new fields.
     * Just copy-paste that into the pii block below and go from there. You may need to clean up some bad
     * guesses and properly configure pagesToSelectiveMask.
     *
     * @prop {String} [maskCharacters] a string containing the character or characters to be randomly
     * chosen to be the replacement for masked characters on the page. Optional, random letters and
     * numbers will be used if this is missing or falsey. Using "****." will mostly use asterisks with
     * the occasional dot to offset the width of the asterisk.
     *
     * @prop {Object} selectiveUnMaskZones this defines areas of pages to be UNMASKED on pages that
     * would normally be completely masked (whitelisting).
     *
     * @prop {Array<String>} pagesToSelectiveMask This identifies page URL's (by wildcard) that switch from automatic
     * mask-everything (whitelisting) to blacklisting. If a page falls into this category, we ignore
     * all rules inside selectiveUnMaskZones and look instead at selectiveMaskZones.
     *
     * @prop {Object} selectiveMaskZones Identifies elements on pages to mask for pages that are in pagesToSelectiveMask.
     * A page must already be in the pagesToSelectiveMask list to qualify for this type of masking.
     *
     * @prop {Object} visibleInputs Identifies inputs, textareas and selects to unblock. Works even when elements are
     *  inserted into document. Only use this when necessary, it's not as efficient.
     *
     * @prop {Object} redactZones Identifies elements to obscuring. This will result in everything inside it to
     * be blacked out, including images and text. This still could reasult in the contents being transmitted
     * to the server, but the viewer will not see it. Useful for profile images and the like.
